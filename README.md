# Discord Bot: A Microchallenge

# Introduction
Learn how to turn yourself into a Discord bot! You’ll use Discord.py to turn your catchphrases or sayings into a bot that anyone can interact
with. This challenge will help you build your skills in Python, and interacting with an existing code library to build a user facing application.

## ✨ Getting Started

create a Discord bot that responds to the following commands:
- respond Hello {name} to command: `$hello`

## 📝 Notes
